## Getting Started

### Get the source code
Make a directory for your project.  Clone or download and extract the code in that directory.

### Install tools
If you don't have them already, you'll need node, bower and gulp to be installed globally on your machine.  

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  This includes npm - the node package manager.  
2. Install [bower](https://bower.io/) globally `npm install bower -g`  
3. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) globally `npm install gulp-cli -g`  

### Install the dependencies
Change directory into the new project you just cloned, then install dependencies.
```
npm install
bower install
```

## Building App
The app can be build using make.  This method works on a Mac with OS X 10.13.6
```
make clean
make all
```

## Running the app locally
The default gulp task will start a local web server.  Just run this command:
```
gulp
```
Browse to http://localhost:5000.
Initially, the app will use mock data for the views service, asset service, and time series service.
Later you can connect your app to real instances of these services.


### Create a distribution version
Use gulp to create a distribution version of your app, which contains vulcanized files for more efficient serving.
You will need to run this command every time before you deploy to the Cloud.
```
gulp dist
```
